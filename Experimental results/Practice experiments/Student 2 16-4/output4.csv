1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,4,
1..,,I like the AI assistence, as it is an easy tool to indentify unstable directions and offers an solution. Classic FEM solvers only say that the structure is unstable in a direction, but can sometimes be difficult to interp.
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,3,
2..,,The assignment is straight forward, but requires some familiarity with the concept of stability
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,5,
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,4,I Dont think that there are any redundant members 
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,3,Considerring that the beams are considered as fixed connections, it should probablly enough to only fix the outer beams
3..,,Considerring that the beams are considered as fixed connections, it should probablly enough to only fix the outer beams
4. Do you think it would have gone better without the AI tool?,No,
4..,,The AI tool is useful to check for instability. Designing a structure without such help requires experience, and my structural designing skills are a bit rusty
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform stabilization better than you?,No idea,
5..,,It can probably theoretically, however there are practical considerations when it comes to structural designing. I dont know if the AI can take that into account
6. What criteria did you keep in mind while performing this assignment?,,Functionality, makebility and usability.
