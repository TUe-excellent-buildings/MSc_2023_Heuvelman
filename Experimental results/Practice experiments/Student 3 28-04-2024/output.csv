1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,3,
Step 3: This time pick the one of which you think its structural design has the highest stiffness. Explain your reasoning.,,1
Step 6: Pick one zoned design you would like to continue with and explain why.,,1
Step 7: This time pick the one of which you think its structural design has the highest stiffness. Explain your reasoning.,,2
1..,,Being completely new with the program it was a little bit hard to pick up what you had to do. for the rest the use of the prgram was pretty nice after a few minutes
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,2,
2..,,You have to properly read the definitions of zones and zoning. without any good idea of what that is its hard to quickly pick up. Maybe at some pictures or more visual examples to make it more clear
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,1,
3..,,I wasnt sure how to interpretate the zones with bigger cuboid than other surrounding onces. so if a space on its own can be a zone. So i dont have high hopes form myself
4. Do you think it would have gone better with an AI tool that identifies all zoned designs for you?,Yes,
4..,,Never been so sure with anything in my life
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform zoning better than you?,Yes,
5..,,Look at the video of the past 30 minutes
6. What criteria did you keep in mind while performing this assignment?,,I only looked at the criteria of structural design and the behaviour of the windload on the building
