1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Step 3: This time pick the one of which you think its structural design has the highest stiffness. Explain your reasoning.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Step 6: Pick one zoned design you would like to continue with and explain why.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Step 7: This time pick the one of which you think its structural design has the highest stiffness. Explain your reasoning.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1..,,"It was nice to think about the zones that are possible, but to be very honest im not entirely sure that i did it correctly. i tried to make the largest zones possible but maybe because the building was two layer and all spaces were more or less connected it led to only two zones most of the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2..,,It was easy to do once you understand the whole concept of zones and zoning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3..,,I did have a little idea about the zoning and identifying them but i did not consider stiffness of the zones at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Do you think it would have gone better with an AI tool that identifies all zoned designs for you?,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4..,,"Yes i think so, because i think AI wouldve done a better job at understanding the zoning and would not have made the error of not considering stiffness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform zoning better than you?,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5..,,I think so too, but that could be because i did not entirely understand the concept. with a little bit more training i think i could have done a similar job as AI or even a bit better in the sense that i could have made less mistakes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. What criteria did you keep in mind while performing this assignment?,,Only functional and aesthetical and logical zoning requirements. I was thinkin more about which zones would be easy to reach by combining which spaces in the building layout,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
