1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,4,
1..,,"I liked working together with the IA. It helps when you are doubting about what to do. You get conformation inbetween that you are doing the right thing. And if you ask AI to make the first sugestion, you can continue on that. At the end it feels like I did a good job."
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,4,
2..,,"It felt easy, but if I had to do it without the help of IA, I think I would have found it harder."
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,5,
3..,,"AI said it was stable. I only needed its help 5 times, and asked again the 6st time if it was stable. "
4. Do you think it would have gone better without the AI tool?,No,
4..,,"I would maybe have gotten to a stable structre. I think I would have added more stability elements. Because at the end I thought I had to add more things at the lower part of the building, but the AI said it was stable already. "
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform stabilization better than you?,Yes,I dont know. It had good sugestions. But it is also nice to look at it yourself.
5..,,I dont know. It had good sugestions. But it is also nice to look at it yourself.
6. What criteria did you keep in mind while performing this assignment?,,"didnt think about astatics, acapt that there shouldnt be diagonals inside the building. I just thought about the structre and stability, what was needed."
