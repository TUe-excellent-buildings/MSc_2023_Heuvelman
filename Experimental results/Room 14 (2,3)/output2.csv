1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,5,
1..,,I liked the process of picking members and adding rods or diagnonals in the structure very much. I thought it was intuitive and easy to perform. The only thing that was strange was that when you cliked the building went upside down. 
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,5,
