1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1..,,The assignment was at first quite hard to understand what was exactly asked of me and what BSD is. I made quite some erros with the adding and removing zones since I dint understand the coordinate system so 10 modifcations was not enougth and endud up with zoned design which was overlapping. And I couldnt fix this anymore. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2..,,The GUI worked really well I think. The mouse rotating was sometimes difficult but overall it worked really well. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3..,,I think I did a terrible job in performing the analysis. I did not had a clear reasoning behing it and could not really efine the why a zone design had a higher compliance than the other one. So that was really dificult.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Do you think it would have gone better without the AI tool?,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4..,,Yess up to some point. I think here a combination of AI and humans are the best solution. It is handy that AI can just delete the first few bad zoned design solutions. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform zoning better than you?,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5..,,Ohh yess definitly!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. What criteria did you keep in mind while performing this assignment?,,Well I took in mind structural aspects like stability. Also architectural asects such as easthetics. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7.  Did you prefer choosing from the limited zoned design options or from all zoned design options?,Limited options,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7..,,I dont want to scroll thourgh many zones, just only give me the ones that are logical and then the human can decide what to do with that I think. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
