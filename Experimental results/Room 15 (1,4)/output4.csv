1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,3,
1..,,My knowledge of basics in structural stability were not very salient to me so I had to recall it which took some time.
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,3,
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,4,See previous response. There were many portals and the rules of the assignment made it a bit more complex (I was not allowed to brace within a space)

3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,4,
3..,,I am pretty confident
4. Do you think it would have gone better without the AI tool?,No,
4..,,I liked to be reassured that the structure was stable.
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform stabilization better than you?,No,
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform stabilization better than you?,No idea,
5..,,I felt that one of its suggestions to my design was redundant.
6. What criteria did you keep in mind while performing this assignment?,,Functional - not crossing interior spaces with braces. Using beams instead of rods for this purpose; Stability - imagining the way the structure would react to loading in various planes.
