1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,4,,,,,,,,,,,
1..,,Find it nice to think about zoning of the building,,,,,,,,,,
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,4,,,,,,,,,,,
2..,,Easy to make zones and think about the desing,,,,,,,,,,
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,3,,,,,,,,,,,
3..,,Not sure if I thought a lot about the stiffness of this building,,,,,,,,,,
4. Do you think it would have gone better without the AI tool?,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,
4..,,Because it has more data to choose from,,,,,,,,,,
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform zoning better than you?,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,
5..,,It has more knowledge than me :),,,,,,,,,,
6. What criteria did you keep in mind while performing this assignment?,,Fuctional and the structural functionallity,,,,,,,,,,
7.  Did you prefer choosing from the limited zoned design options or from all zoned design options?,Limited options,,,,,,,,,,,
7..,,Less to choose from and a easier choice because of you not have to compare lots of different options,,,,,,,,,,
