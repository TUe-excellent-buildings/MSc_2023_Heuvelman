1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,4,,,,,,,,
1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,3,It is fun to do, ,,,,,,
1..,,It is fun to do, but sometimes a bit hard to see where the zones are divided which makes it hard to choose,,,,,,
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,3,,,,,,,,
2..,,It is quite easy to do and with the sheet given with a short explanation it makes it even easier. Sometimes it is just not very visible and making a decision can be very difficult without a lot of background,,,,,,,
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,2,,,,,,,,
3..,,I kind of understand it, but there was not a lot of explanation on that part on the additional sheet so that makes decision making very difficult,,,,,,
4. Do you think it would have gone better without the AI tool?,No idea,,,,,,,,
4..,,Maybe it would have gone better, but if understood correctly than it can definetly help with the decision making process,,,,,,
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform zoning better than you?,No,,,,,,,,
5..,,I think that you can sometimes see it better yourself and create the zones based on the system you want to use, instead of having AI do it for you,,,,,,
6. What criteria did you keep in mind while performing this assignment?,,Mainly the zoning requirements, and afterwards saw the logic in how it can be structurally used,,,,,,
7.  Did you prefer choosing from the limited zoned design options or from all zoned design options?,Limited options,,,,,,,,
7..,,Makes it easier to choose from, and not have problems with identifying all different options,,,,,,
