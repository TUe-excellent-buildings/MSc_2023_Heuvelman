1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,3,
1..,,"The assignment itself was nice, but stabilization itself is not a topic in which my interest lay, there only a 3"
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,4,
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,2,You need knowledge of stability yourself and have to predict what happens to the structure. Therefore I think the assignment was 
2..,,You need knowledge of stability yourself and have to predict what happens to the structure. Therefore I think the assignment was quite difficult to preform. 
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,3,
3..,,"I think I put in too much stability members, and as I have mentioned before, stability is not a great topic for me so I think the results are not that well"
4. Do you think it would have gone better with an AI tool that identifies all zoned designs for you?,Yes,
4..,,I think it is helpfull if the tool would display  the structure is stable. This because I was really doubting if I needed more element and ended up adding more and more elements. Suggestions of elements would be less helpfull because this is easy to do yourself. 
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform zoning better than you?,Yes,
"5..,",,"I think AI tools can run stabilization test quick, and therefore get more results. But I still think these results should be checked. Maybe if I had more knowlegde about stabilization this would not be the case "
6. What criteria did you keep in mind while performing this assignment?,,Only stability elements considering mostly wind loads
