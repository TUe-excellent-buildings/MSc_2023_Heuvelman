1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,4,,,,,,,
1..,,I think the set up of the assignment was nice, especially the part in which the numbers were shown, so you could see what the effect of the design was,,,,
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,3,,,,,,,
2..,,I think the zoning was quite nice, but I still found it difficult to choose between designs. Maybe this is because my knowlegde of zoning is not that large and I did not know which criteria should be looked at ,,,,,
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,1,,,,,,,
3..,,The zoning of building space are quite new to me so I do not know how to choose between spaces,,,,,,
4. Do you think it would have gone better without the AI tool?,No,,,,,,,
4..,,Because then I should have zoned the building myself and since  I do not know what a good zoning is this would have been even harder,,,,,,
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform zoning better than you?,Yes,,,,,,,
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform zoning better than you?,No idea,,,,,,,
5..,,,,,,,,
6. What criteria did you keep in mind while performing this assignment?,,Maybe a little bit on structural aspects but I did not know what I was doing,,,,,,
7.  Did you prefer choosing from the limited zoned design options or from all zoned design options?,No idea,,,,,,,
