1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,3,,,,,,,,,,,
1..,,I think some more information is necessary. More clear the function of the zones. It says something about stiff connections, but for the structural performance, the span is important as well. So I think the questions should be made more clear.,,,,,,,,
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,3,,,,,,,,,,,
2..,,It was not clear enough for me,,,,,,,,,,
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,2,,,,,,,,,,,
3..,,To be honest, I think I did not understand the assignment enough to perform well. So I think I performed very badly,,,,,,,,,
4. Do you think it would have gone better without the AI tool?,No,,,,,,,,,,,
4..,,No, I think it helped me. Without AI, it would be very unclear I think.,,,,,,,,
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform zoning better than you?,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,
5..,,I think so,,,,,,,,,,
6. What criteria did you keep in mind while performing this assignment?,,Zoning requirements and structural. But as the function of zoning was not very clear to me, I did not consider aesthetics or functional ,,,,,,,,,
7.  Did you prefer choosing from the limited zoned design options or from all zoned design options?,Limited options,,,,,,,,,,,
