1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,4,
1..,,"The assignment was clear, but changing the elements was a bit difficult at times, as it was sometimes hard to read the element id numbers. The view also kept resetting which was a bit of an annoyance."
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,3,
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,4,The stabilization process was quite straightforward
2..,,The stabilization process was quite straightforward
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,2,
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,3,
3..,,"I think I performed reasonably well. I made sure that there were bracings in the structure in both X and Y direction. I was not sure however how many bracing would exactly be needed. I also did not take into account rotational stability. I also converted all the horizontal elements to beams since I assumed they would transfer bending moments as well, but this could probably also have been reduced. "
4. Do you think it would have gone better with an AI tool that identifies all zoned designs for you?,Yes,
4..,,"I believe providing a suggestion would have helped, because now I was not sure whether the total structure would have been stable"
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform zoning better than you?,Yes,
"5..,",,I think creating a stable structure could be straightforward as it only needs to adhere to a certain set of rules or follow a certain set of steps. AI would probably be better at performing these steps better than me
6. What criteria did you keep in mind while performing this assignment?,,horizontal stability in both directions as well as beams that can carry the bending moments introduced by the floor
