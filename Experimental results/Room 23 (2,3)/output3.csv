1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,3,,,,,,,,,,,
1..,,Rotating and viewing the models was a bit difficult. The view would reset each time I wanted to rotate, which was a bit annoying and slightly disoriented me. Looking at which zones were connected was also a bit difficult to see due to the overlapping colors, but the numbering helped a lot.,,,,,,,,
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,3,,,,,,,,,,,
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,2,,,,,,,,,,,
2..,,It was a bit hard to make decisions, because I wasnt exactly sure how my choices would affect the eventual structural design or what the eventual goal of the design would have to be.,,,,,,,,,
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,2,,,,,,,,,,,
3..,,I have no particular prior experience in zoning a collection of spaces based on their stiffness or structural performance, so I did not think I would have performed very well. I also did not take into account effects of e.g. wind loads or rotational stiffness in the designs,,,,,,,,,
4. Do you think it would have gone better without the AI tool?,No idea,,,,,,,,,,,
4..,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform zoning better than you?,No idea,,,,,,,,,,,
5..,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. What criteria did you keep in mind while performing this assignment?,,Whether zones were aligning above each other for a more efficient load distribution and stability. I also tried to reason the zoned designs based on a functional and aesthetical requirement, for example that big open spaces would be preferable for an office function,,,,,,,,,
7.  Did you prefer choosing from the limited zoned design options or from all zoned design options?,All options,,,,,,,,,,,

7.  Did you prefer choosing from the limited zoned design options or from all zoned design options?,All options,,,,,,,,,,,
7..,,In my eyes there were no significant differences between the two zoned designs, so I would have preferred to still view the other possible options,,,,,,,,,
