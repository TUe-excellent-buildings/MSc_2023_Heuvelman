1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,5,,,,,,,,,,,
1..,,Nice interaction between a computer (AI) and me as user. Certainly for prototyping I could see a great benefit in the program. The compliance score and structural weight are very valuable in that regard. ,,,,,,,,,,
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,4,,,,,,,,,,,
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,3,,,,,,,,,,,
2..,,The assignment said _pick one_ without indicating what to base your choice upon. That might have been done deliberately but it made _picking one_ a bit harder.,,,,,,,,,,
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,4,,,,,,,,,,,

4. Do you think it would have gone better without the AI tool?,No,,,,,,,,,,,
4..,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform zoning better than you?,No idea,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform zoning better than you?,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,
5..,,An AI is (most likely) way quicker and more complete in finding all possible zoning variants.,,,,,,,,,,
6. What criteria did you keep in mind while performing this assignment?,,Structural.,,,,,,,,,,
7.  Did you prefer choosing from the limited zoned design options or from all zoned design options?,All options,,,,,,,,,,,
7..,,"I mostly liked all options,  and then with the structural mass and indication for stiffness (compliance) so it gives you all the options and you can pick yourself. But I can imagine this becomes hard for larger more complicate structures with many options.",,,,,,,,,,
