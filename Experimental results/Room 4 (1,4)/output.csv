1..,,"It was a bit hard to start thinking about the correct zoning at first,  but it was kind of fun to determines the various zoned designs  even for spaces that I chose that were really nog very practical to use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2..,,Zoning was not very hard as the boundaries showed what possibilites you have. However  determining the space layout is a bit harder in my opinion  because I just at one point started to create a certain volume but therefore it became quite complicated to construct practical zonings and a decent zoned design,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3..,,"I think I could identify the zoned designs,  but I am doubting if it always was the most stiff structure I chose  since especially in the design your spaces part I did construct something very unconvenient",,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Do you think it would have gone better with an AI tool that identifies all zoned designs for you?,No idea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Do you think it would have gone better with an AI tool that identifies all zoned designs for you?,Yes,Hard to say, because AI needs,,,,,,,,,,,,
4..,,I think a well trained AI tool could identify this better  if the boundaries with respect to stiffness of the structure are communicated precisely. However this is maybe a bit hard as the definition of  the stiffest structure could be interpreted by humans in many ways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform zoning better than you?,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5..,,Probably it will,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. What criteria did you keep in mind while performing this assignment?,,"I looked at functional, aesthetical and structural criteria to the extent that it was possible. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
