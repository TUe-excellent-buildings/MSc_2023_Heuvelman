1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,3,,,,,,,,,,,
1..,,It is interesting to see what AI does but I would have liked to make an actual structural design with it. ,,,,,,,,,,
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,4,,,,,,,,,,,
2..,,The decisions were either based on preference or for the structural part based on given numbers so it was rather easy,,,,,,,,,,
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,3,,,,,,,,,,,
3..,,It is partially preference but for the structural part I think I did alright,,,,,,,,,,
4. Do you think it would have gone better without the AI tool?,No,,,,,,,,,,,
4..,,AI is much faster then I would have been and I would not have been able to generate as much options as AI did which would probably result in a result that is less good.,,,,,,,,,,
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform zoning better than you?,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,
5..,,I do think AI is better in this than me because I do not know that much about zoning. ,,,,,,,,,,
6. What criteria did you keep in mind while performing this assignment?,,Mostly structural,,,,,,,,,,
7.  Did you prefer choosing from the limited zoned design options or from all zoned design options?,All options,,,,,,,,,,,
7.  Did you prefer choosing from the limited zoned design options or from all zoned design options?,Limited options,,,,,,,,,,,
7..,,I am often quite indecisive so this made it more easy. However there might have been nicer options if all options were displayed,,,,,,,,,,
