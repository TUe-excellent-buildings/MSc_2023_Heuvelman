1. How much did you enjoy performing this assignment?,2,
1..,,little bit confusing, re-arranging is not very intuative, and the limit gives me stress that I need to do the right steps pefectly to make the space how I want it to look
2. How would you rate the level of ease in performing this assignment?,1,
2..,,
3. How well do you think you performed the assignment?,2,
3..,,quite confusing and I think that I could do better if not so much restriction is placed on me
4. Do you think it would have gone better without the AI tool?,No idea,
4..,,for the first one yes, because I was thrown into a random space division and had no idea about the concept behind this space division. but for my own space division I think that as a designer I had a more integrated conceptual idea between the spacial layout and the zoning
5. Do you think the AI tool itself can perform zoning better than you?,No,
5..,,some of the zoning option by the AI were kinda bad. but not all!
6. What criteria did you keep in mind while performing this assignment?,,what types of spaces I need, proximety of spaces, height and length of spaces,no strural elements disturbing the middle of a zone below
